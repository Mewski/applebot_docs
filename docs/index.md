# Welcome to Apple Bot Documentation
This is the documentation for Apple Bot. As you can see, this documentation is just getting started, so a lot of commands are lacking. 
Feel free to contribute by clicking the github repository at the top right an pull-requesting your additions back to these docs. Your help would be appreciated.

If there are bugs when using the bot, please join our support server and I will further assist you there. The invite is https://discord.gg/ZZNSfkd
# Bot Modules
## Moderation
The moderation module has many commands that can help you with moderating your server. All commands in this module currently require you to have the 
`ADMINISTRATOR` permission in order to use it. This will be customizable and changable in the future.
View Commands [here](moderation.md)
## Music
This bot can grab many types of videos/audios from the internet and stream it into your VC. All the commands related to the playback of music would be in this module. You can even pass a mp3 file from the internet and the bot will play it in the VC.
## Utilities
Useful utilites that can make your life easier. Featuring an OCR reader from google tesseract, or just discord utilities such as viewing the information of a user.
## Fun
Fun commands for users to use. This includes virtual relationships like marrying, and just offright memes such as fakebanning someone.
## Settings
Commands in this category are for customizing the bot. You can use `[prefix]setting view` to view a setting and `[prefix]setting edit` to edit a setting.
