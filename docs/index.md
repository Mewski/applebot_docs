# Welcome to Apple Bot Documentation
This is the documentation for Apple Bot. As you can see, this documentation is just getting started, so a lot of commands are lacking. 
Feel free to contribute by clicking the github repository at the top right an pull-requesting your additions back to these docs. Your help is appreciated.
# Bot Modules
## Moderation
The moderation module has many commands that can help you with moderating your server. All commands in this module currently require you to have the 
`ADMINISTRATOR` permission in order to use it. This will be customizable and changable in the future.
View Commands [here](moderation.md)
## Music
This bot can grab many types of videos/audios from the internet and stream it into your VC. All the commands related to the playback of music would be in this module. 
## Fun
